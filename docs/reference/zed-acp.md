# Use Zuno in Zed through ACP

Zuno exposes a native Agent Client Protocol (ACP) server over standard input
and standard output. Zed can launch that server as a custom external Agent.
The upstream Zed configuration contract is documented in
[External agents](https://zed.dev/docs/ai/external-agents); Zuno's implemented
protocol boundary and pinned upstream evidence are documented in
[Zed ACP integration](../design/zed-acp-integration.md).

## 1. Verify the installed Zuno binary

Locate the same binary that Zed should launch:

```sh
# Linux and macOS
command -v zuno
zuno acp --check
```

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
(Get-Command zuno).Source
zuno acp --check
```

The check must complete without starting a session and print:

```text
ACP stdio adapter ready (protocol v1; schema v1.21.0)
```

If a terminal finds `zuno` but Zed does not, use the absolute path reported by
`command -v zuno` or `Get-Command zuno`. Desktop applications often receive a
different `PATH` from an interactive shell.

## 2. Add Zuno as a custom Zed Agent

Open Zed's Agent Panel, open Agent Settings, select **Add Agent**, then
**Add Custom Agent**. The equivalent Zed settings entry is:

```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "Zuno": {
      "type": "custom",
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/zuno",
      "args": ["acp"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

An absolute executable path is the most reliable form. Examples:

### Linux

```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "Zuno": {
      "type": "custom",
      "command": "/home/you/.local/bin/zuno",
      "args": ["acp"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### macOS

```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "Zuno": {
      "type": "custom",
      "command": "/Users/you/.local/bin/zuno",
      "args": ["acp"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

### Windows

JSON strings require escaped backslashes:

```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "Zuno": {
      "type": "custom",
      "command": "C:\\Users\\you\\.local\\bin\\zuno.exe",
      "args": ["acp"],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

Do not wrap the command in a shell script that writes banners or status text
to stdout. ACP stdout contains only newline-delimited JSON-RPC frames.

## 3. Choose the Zuno configuration used by Zed

Zed sends the selected project as an absolute working directory. Zuno resolves
the same global and project `zuno.json`/`zuno.jsonc` chain it uses in the TUI:

- global configuration under the platform configuration root;
- project configuration from the worktree and `.zuno/` layers;
- configured Agent definitions, Skills, extensions, MCP servers, permissions,
  sandbox policy, providers, and models.

Provider login and credentials remain Zuno-owned. Configure and verify them
before starting the Zed Agent:

```sh
zuno debug config
zuno auth list
zuno models
```

Do not copy provider secrets into Zed settings merely to make ACP start. Use
Zuno's credential store or the provider environment variables described in
[Providers and credentials](providers.md).

To select an existing switchable configuration overlay for this Zed Agent,
set `ZUNO_CONFIG_DIR` in the custom Agent environment:

```json
{
  "agent_servers": {
    "Zuno (Kiro profile)": {
      "type": "custom",
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/zuno",
      "args": ["acp"],
      "env": {
        "ZUNO_CONFIG_DIR": "/home/you/.config/zuno/profiles/kiro"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

On Windows, use an escaped absolute path. Multiple Zed entries may launch the
same Zuno binary with different `ZUNO_CONFIG_DIR` overlays.

## 4. Select `deep` or another session Agent

A new ACP session resolves Zuno's normal default Agent and model. Zuno then
publishes these session controls to Zed:

- **Mode**: Build or Plan;
- **Agent**: the available implementation Agents;
- **Model**: models from the resolved Zuno provider catalog.

To use the directly selectable `deep` Agent:

1. create a Zuno external-Agent thread;
2. keep **Mode** set to **Build**;
3. open the **Agent** configuration selector and choose `deep`;
4. choose the desired model if the current Zuno profile exposes more than one.

Plan mode always activates the read-only `plan` Agent. Returning to Build mode
restores the selected implementation Agent. Agent and model changes are
session-local and are rejected while a prompt is actively running.

`zuno acp` does not accept an `--agent` launch argument. Agent selection is an
ACP session configuration operation, not a second process-level configuration
surface.

## 5. Permissions, tools, diffs, and lifecycle

Zed presents permission and elicitation requests, but Zuno remains the policy
owner:

- Zuno permission rules decide whether a tool runs, is denied, or asks;
- Zuno's Shell sandbox controls filesystem and network authority;
- native file tools emit typed creation and edit diffs for Zed;
- Zuno-configured MCP servers remain available when the selected Agent profile
  permits them;
- cancellation, session load, resume, close, plan state, usage, and tool
  history use the same durable runtime as the TUI.

ACP-provided client MCP, client filesystem RPC, and terminal RPC are not
advertised. Prompt text and `resource_link` content are supported; prompt image,
audio, and embedded-resource capabilities are currently not advertised.

## 6. Troubleshooting

### Agent fails to start

Run the exact configured command in a terminal:

```sh
/absolute/path/to/zuno acp --check
```

Check that the binary is executable, its configuration/data directories are
writable, and its configured provider can be resolved. An absolute command path
avoids most GUI `PATH` differences.

### Provider or model is missing

Run:

```sh
zuno debug config
zuno auth list
zuno models
```

If the Zed entry uses `ZUNO_CONFIG_DIR`, use the same environment while running
these commands. Project-specific configuration depends on the folder opened in
Zed.

### Protocol or tool stream is malformed

In Zed, run:

```text
dev: open acp logs
```

For temporary Zuno diagnostics, change the arguments to:

```json
"args": ["acp", "--print-logs", "--log-level", "DEBUG"]
```

`--print-logs` writes diagnostics to stderr. It does not place logs on ACP
stdout. Remove verbose logging after diagnosis.

### Agent or model selector is absent

Confirm Zed connected successfully, then create a new external-Agent thread.
Run `zuno acp --check` to verify the production adapter, and inspect the ACP
logs for initialization or session-creation errors.

## 7. Acceptance checks

After configuration:

1. open a real project folder in Zed and create a Zuno Agent thread;
2. select `deep`, send a read-only repository question, and confirm reasoning
   and tool updates stream incrementally;
3. request one file edit under an ask policy and confirm Zed displays both the
   permission request and typed diff;
4. cancel a running prompt and confirm the session returns to idle;
5. close and reload the session and confirm content, tools, plan, and usage are
   replayed once.

Repository-level ACP verification is:

```sh
cargo test -p zuno-acp
cargo test -p zuno-cli --test acp_stdio
```
